# Open-Studio

## Website Redesign Repository

This repository contains the redesign of [OpenStudioCorp.github.io], a project aimed at improving the user experience and visual aesthetics of the original website.

Technologies Used:

- **Svelte UI framework**.
- **Vanilla CSS** - We don't use any additional libraries or preprocessors.
- **Node.JS package manager**.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

## Prerequisites

Node.js (version 12 or higher) and npm (Node Package Manager) must be installed on your system.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/OpenStudioCorp/NewOpenStudioCorpSite.git`
Navigate to the project directory:

`cd NewOpenStudioCorpSite`
Install the project dependencies:

`npm install`

## Development

To start the development server and preview the website locally, run the following command:

`npm run dev`
This will compile the Svelte components, start a local development server, and open the website in your default browser. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically trigger a hot reload, allowing you to see the updates instantly.

## Building for Production

To build the optimized production version of the website, you can use the following command:

`npm run build`

This will generate a public directory containing the optimized static assets that can be deployed to a web server.
